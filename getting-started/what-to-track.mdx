## Your Comprehensive Tracking and Integration Guide
To fully leverage Hyperengage and understand user interactions within your product, it's essential to capture:

- Who your **Users** are (e.g. their email address, role, etc.)
- What **actions** they undertake.

If you're new to tracking, don't worry. We'll walk you through how to set it up. Before we delve deeper, here are some basic tips to optimize your Hyperengage experience:

### Begin with 5 Events
For those new to information tracking, it might seem daunting with all the potential events to track. We recommend starting simple:

- `Signed up`
- `Performed an important action` (e.g., `Checked out`, `Created Data`)
- `Trial Started`
- `Team Member Invited`

Use the Object-Action convention for naming events, such as `Project Created` or `Message Dispatched`. The shorter and more descriptive the event name, the better

### Start with 5 Traits
Traits offer a refined way to filter and focus on particular user and company groups. Consider the following 5 traits we recommend:

- Subscription status (e.g., `Free`, `Trial`, `Paid`)
- Role (e.g., `Admin`, `Editor`, `Viewer`)
- Job title (e.g., `CEO`, `Developer`, `Designer`)
- Signup source (e.g., `Organic`, `Referral`, `Paid Ad`)
- Name & Email

For B2B models, emphasize company-related traits. B2C models should focus on user-specific traits.

## Integrating Hyperengage with Segment

Hyperengage streamlines the process of syncing your user and account data. By linking your account, `identify`, `track`, and `group` calls with user or account data will be processed by Hyperengage, bypassing the need for manual API integrations.

We advocate for the Segment B2B Spec for dispatching account lifecycle events. Hyperengage is fully compatible with these events. For instance:

- `Signed Up` - Generates a user profile in Hyperengage
- `Account Created` - Initiates a new account in Hyperengage
- `Account Added User` and `Account Removed User` - Modifies user status within an account

To integrate with Segment, head to the `Integrations` tab in Hyperengage, click on the Segment logo, and proceed with the guided steps. You'll need to authenticate with your Segment account to grant Hyperengage access.
