## Your Comprehensive Tracking and Integration Guide
To fully leverage Hyperengage and understand user interactions within your product, it's essential to capture:

- Who your **Users** are (e.g. their email address, role, etc.)
- What **actions** they undertake.

If you're new to tracking, don't worry. We'll walk you through how to set it up. Before we dive deeper, here are some basic tips to optimize your Hyperengage experience:

### Begin with 5 Events
For those new to information tracking, it might seem daunting with all the potential events to track. We recommend starting simple:

- `Signed up`
- `Performed an important action` (e.g., `Onboarding Completed`, `Enabled Integration`)
- `Trial Started`
- `Team Member Invited`

Use the Object-Action convention for naming events, such as `Project Created` or `Message Dispatched`. The shorter and more descriptive the event name, the better

### Start with 5 Traits for User
Traits offer a refined way to filter and focus on particular user and company groups. Consider the following 5 traits we recommend:

- job_role (e.g., `Admin`, `Editor`, `Viewer`)
- title (e.g., `CEO`, `Developer`, `Designer`)
- signup_source (e.g., `Organic`, `Referral`, `Paid Ad`)
- first_name, last_name and email 
- is_active ( Set this to True or False based on if the user has been deactivated)

For B2B models, emphasize company-related traits. B2C models should focus on user-specific traits.

### Start with 5 Traits for companies/groups/accounts
We recommend for you to consider company/group as set of users that you sell to collective in some cases it can be workspaces or in some cases organisation.
Traits offer a refined way to filter and focus on particular company groups. Consider the following 5 traits we recommend:

- name (e.g., `Hubspot`, `Intercom`, `Planetscale`)
- created_at (e.g., `ISO-8601 timestamp ( this is the date the company signed up to your product))
- mrr and arr ( Set these as they can help you analyse impact on revenue of tragted alerts for churn and opprtunities)
- is_trial ( True or False , set this to true if the the trial is started), this is used to categorize accounts into subscribed or trial bucket
- (Optional) trial_start_date and trial_expiry_date can be set to ISO-8601 timestamp.
- (Optional) is_churned ( Set this to true if the account has churned or cancelled )

For B2B models, emphasize company-related traits. B2C models should focus on user-specific traits.
