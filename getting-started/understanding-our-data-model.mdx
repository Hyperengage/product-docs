## Data requirements

**Tier-1 Accounts User profiles and usage events** 

- **Accounts and user profiles**
    - Link your segment account or send directly via our tracking API
        - Some details on common fields that we expect in the data to add maximum value

- **Mapping of entities across data sources:** when multiple data sources collect information on the same physical user or account, a map of entities across these different sources must be provided, i.e. the map would say, ‚Äúthis account in Salesforce is this user group in the product‚Äù.

## Accessing your data: how we connect to your data

We connect to your data in the following ways:

1. **Streaming event sources like Segment** (no engineering lift; requires setting up Hyperengage as a destination in the sources admin panel)
    1. HE receives events directly from Segment or another Webhook and stores them in our own data warehouse.
    2. The customer must OAuth into Segment and configure Hyperengage as a destination (takes 1-2 minutes).
    - **üìå QUICK START: Instructions for Connecting Segment**
        
        

<Accordion title="üö¶ 3 Simple Steps to Connect Segment">

1. Sign up at app.hyperengage.io
2. Walk through the onboarding flow that has a guide on how to connect segment as a source 
    - Note: we recommend using client-side tracking as the source, or whatever would be tracking the most relevant event data to understand how users are using the product.

### üßæ Checklist for success with Segment

- [ ] Added Hyperengage as a destination in Segment
- [ ] Segment track, identify, and group calls are implemented
    - [ ] Segment track calls contain top-level `userId`
    - [ ] Segment identify calls contain top-level `userId`
    - [ ] Segment identify calls contain `email` trait
    - [ ] Segment group calls contain `groupId` as top-level field
    - [ ] Segment group calls contain a trait that can be used to map to accounts in CRM and other apps

2. **Application sources like Salesforce, Stripe, etc** (COMING SOON) (no engineering lift; require user credentials to these applications)
    1. Hyperengage will pull data directly from these sources using ETL and store it in our own data warehouse.
    2. The customer must provide an API token or walk through an OAuth flow.

- If the `is_churned` field is set to `True`, the account is marked as **churned**.
- The `created_at` field is interpreted as the **Signup_date**.
- Custom traits can be sent based on the following:
    - Allowed data types: number, boolean, timestamp (UTC timestamp with timezone string), float, and arrays (either of strings or numbers).
